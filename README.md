# my-projects
Here is a repository containing some projects I have done for school and on my own.
I did not include a few of my neural network projects because they contain too many files for the training and testing data.
The majority of my courseload over the past year has been focused in artificial intelligence, with emphasis on machine learning, as well as algorithms and operating systems.  

I will be graduating from San Diego State University with a BS in Computer Science in May 2022.  I am currently looking for a full-time role for post graduation in the CS field.
